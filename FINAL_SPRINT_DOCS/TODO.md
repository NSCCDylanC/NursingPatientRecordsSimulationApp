## Michelle's notes

- Hygiene Options in ADL are NOT mandatory -- remove validation from that test

- **Patient Profile:** Height editability removed, and 'no changes' button removed

- **Assessments:**
  - Radio buttons in tests: should be able to un-click an option. 
  - Leaving a test with unsaved changes requires a CUSTOM alert.
  
- **Elimination Test:** 
  - Add 'Last BM' with a date 


- **assessment summary**
  - Move to Patient Profile
    - IF nurse is looking at summary while on a test, it should pre-filter to THAT test specifically. 

- **Patient Summary**
  - Updated by: Nurse 2 via System (change System to nurse email)


- **Nav**
  - User name next to login
  - Publish button moved to nav
